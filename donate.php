                        At Resurtech, we currently accept donations of old laptops.
                        Before you donate, please review our guidelines:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fw-bold">Functionality: </span>The laptop should
                            be in working condition and able to power on. If otherwise,
                            please donate regardless for a responsible recycling.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fw-bold">Security: </span>If possible, the device
                            should be securely wiped of all personal data, including
                            files, passwords, and other sensitive information, to protect
                            the privacy of the owner. If not, not to worry, we will
                            securely wipe it as part of the refurbishing process.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fw-bold">Cleanliness: </span>Please ensure the
                            laptop is cleaned and sanitized to prevent the spread of
                            germs.

                        Before donating Apple laptops, please ensure they are removed
                        from the owner's iCloud account to allow others to register
                        them. If you need assistance with this process, please reach out
