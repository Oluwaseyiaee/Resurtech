                    <p>
                        At Resurtech, our mission to provide free tech devices is
                        essential in bridging the digital divide and enhancing access to
                        technology for those in need, all while minimizing electronic
                        waste in landfills. This effort often involves collaboration
                        with organizations dedicated to increasing digital literacy and
                        ensuring equitable technology access. You can contribute
                        meaningfully by volunteering in the following ways:
                    </p>

                            we're doing but at your local community level. We can help you
                            get started based on our past experiences.
